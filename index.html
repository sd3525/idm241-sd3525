      <div class="title">The Overview:</div>
      <hr />
      <div class="details">
        For this project, I was assigned to create a micro-interaction with 5
        triggers for a website. I created a quick add option for the website:
        Golf le Fleur. A user can preview the name of the shoe, the different
        color options, and add to cart. One of the problems that I ran into was
        making the cart icon change to show a number one above it on click. I
        figured it out through research and understanding that the order of my
        variables can impact the functionality of my code. This was the last
        part of my code that I needed to figure out so once it was functioning
        my micro-interaction was done!

          <div class="details">
            On week one of class we were assigned to create a fully functioning
            micro-interaction with 5 triggers in order to improve a website of
            our choice. We were given 11 weeks to complete the 5 interactions,
            but it was split up into a alpha, beta, and a final build stage. We
            had around 2 weeks to create the one alpha trigger, 3 weeks to
            create 2 more beta triggers, and 4 weeks to create the final 2
            triggers for the final.

          <div class="subhead">The Problem:</div>
          <div class="details">
            This project teaches students how micro-interactions can really
            enhance a website and ultimately make it more engaging and
            intuitive. It was important for us as students to learn how to
            implement them so that we could ultimately better a website that we
            didn't didn't originally see to be intuitive.

          <div class="subhead">Goals & Objectives:</div>
          <div class="details">
            The project will be considered successful if the full 5 trigger
            micro-interaction functions and is described properly and enhances
            the website in some way.

      <div class="subhead">Research:</div>
      <div class="details">
        In order to figure out the proper solution to the problem of the Golf le
        Fleur website I analyzed the website and looked for things that I could
        improve. I looked at the home page where there were images of all of the
        products and noticed that there were no details on the product. Only
        once I clicked it could I see the name and different color options for
        the product. I figured that a users main goal is to purchase an item as
        quick as possible and they don't want to have to keep clicking in order
        to find details on the product and add it to cart. I did market research
        by looking at other clothing stores and saw that they had a quick add
        option and that a user could easily switch through the color options
        without going to the item detail page.
      </div>
      <div class="subhead">Code:</div>
      <div class="details">
        For the alpha build portion of the assignment I made my one interaction
        hover on and off. A box with a border and GLF 2.0 would need to appear
        over the shoe. I looked on code pen for how to do hover on and off for
        text and a background with a border and found a similar project so I was
        able to easily code it.
      </div>
      <div class="details">
        For the beta build portion of the project I needed to put the same hover
        on and off function on the smaller different colored shoes and get the
        big image of the shoe to change color when you clicked on them. I found
        a video online explaing how to make an image change when clicking on a
        button which helped me to undestand how to apply the same concept to my
        code!
      </div>
      <div class="details">
        The last steps for the final project was put in a cart icon so that when
        a user hovered on it, it would enlargen and then when they clicked on it
        a one would pop up over it. I ran into an issue was making the cart icon
        change, but figured it out through research and remembering that the
        order of my variables can impact the functionality of my code. I
        realized that I had attatched my javascript file that was for the cart
        icon at the bottom of the page so it wasn't reading it when I was
        running the code, which was a very foolish mistake that I only noticed
        after an hour of struggling. I also had an issue that when I would hover
        near the large image it would start flickering. I realized that this
        meant that my target area was too big so I made the image smaller. Once
        I implemented these two fixes my final project was finally working
        perfectly!

      <hr />

      <div class="details">
        In the end I decided to make the cart above the box so that it didn't
        look like it was awkardly floating to the side of the shoe. Now when the
        user hovers on the shoe the box with the text and border forms right
        under the cart. To interact with the cart the user can hover over it to
        enlarge it and then click to add to cart. Then when the user hovers over
        the shoes a solid black border forms around it which signals that it can
        be clicked and that way the user can change the shoe color on the large
        image.

      <div class="title">The Results:</div>
      <hr />
      <div class="details">
        This project ended up being a success because all 5 of the triggers work
        and it allows the user to quickly preview an item and add it to their
        cart, which was not possible before.
